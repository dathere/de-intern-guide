### 📓 Markdown Editors

Here are some Markdown editors you can use for taking notes:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (you may need to purchase a commercial license)
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)

These programs often have extra features that can be useful for taking notes, such as the ability to create kanban boards, embed images, and more. However, they do support Markdown. Also, you can instead make a new Markdown file in your favorite text editor like Visual Studio Code by saving a file with the `.md` extension.
