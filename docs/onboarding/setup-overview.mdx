## 😎 Cool Tools!

| Software/Tool                                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)                                    | VirtualBox is a virtualization software that allows you to run a virtual machine on your computer. Simply put, this program lets you have virtual computers inside your computer!                                                                    |
| [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)                                                | Ubuntu is a free and open-source operating system. It is a Linux distribution and is often useful for running on virtual machines.                                                                                                                   |
| [qsv](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv)                                    | qsv (pronounced "Quicksilver") is a command line program for indexing, slicing, analyzing, filtering, enriching, validating & joining CSV files. Commands are simple, fast & composable.                                                             |
| [CKAN](https://ckan.org)                                                     | CKAN is an open-source DMS (data management system) for powering data hubs and data portals. CKAN makes it easy to publish, share, and use data. It powers hundreds of data portals worldwide.                                                       |
| [DataPusher+ with Docker](https://github.com/dathere/datapusher-plus-docker) | [DataPusher+](https://github.com/dathere/datapusher-plus) is standalone web service that pushes data into the CKAN DataStore fast & reliably. We'll be setting up a containerized version of DataPusher+ by using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). |

## 🧩 Putting It All Together

We'll use VirtualBox to create a virtual machine (VM) running Ubuntu. On your VM you can use and contribute to qsv, CKAN (including CKAN extensions), DataPusher+, and much more! 🚀

:::info One more thing! 🎈

Though using a VM is not required and you can do development on your own setup, the guide will cover running an Ubuntu guest OS through a VM using VirtualBox on a Windows 10 host OS. If you're using a different setup (such as a different host OS), you may need to adjust your steps accordingly.
