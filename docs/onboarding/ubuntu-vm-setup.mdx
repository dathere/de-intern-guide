# üíª Ubuntu VM Setup

In this section we cover how to install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) on your operating system (OS) and run [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) 22.04.2 LTS on a virtual machine (VM).

:::info Using macOS?

If you're using macOS, you may also look into [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) and [VMWare Fusion Pro](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion) (see [this issue](https://github.com/dathere/de-intern-guide/issues/29) for more info) instead of VirtualBox.

## üìù Written Tutorial

You may find more comprehensive instructions and details on the [online user manual for VirtualBox 7.0](https://docs.oracle.com/en/virtualization/virtualbox/7.0/user/index.html).

### üì• Download VirtualBox & the Extension Pack

1. Go to the [VirtualBox downloads page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
2. Download the **VirtualBox platform package** based on your computer's OS.

For example, since I'm on a computer running Windows 10 as my OS, then I would choose "Windows hosts".

3. Download the **VirtualBox Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack**.

To fix this issue, install the appropriate package for your system from [this website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022).

Choose the correct download link for your system. On Windows 10 you can find your system type by opening the **System Information** app and reading the **System Type** value.

2. Download Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS by clicking the green **Download 22.04.2** button.

![VirtualBox Name & OS](/img/docs/onboarding/ubuntu-vm-setup/virtualbox-name-and-os.png)

3. Enter a valid username, password, hostname (this is what Ubuntu considers its name as), and enable Guest Additions along with pointing to its `.iso` file. Then click **Next**.

![VirtualBox Guest OS Setup](/img/docs/onboarding/ubuntu-vm-setup/virtualbox-guest-os-setup.png)

4. Set the Base Memory and Processors to the appropriate settings. You may have different values but a general guideline is to stay anywhere within the green section up until the border with the orange section. Generally the more you allocate, the faster the VM. Then click **Next**.

5. Select **Create a Virtual Hard Disk Now** and set a Disk Size of at least 25 GB. Then click **Next**.
