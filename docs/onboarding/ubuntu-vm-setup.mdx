1. Go to the [VirtualBox downloads page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
2. Download the **VirtualBox platform package** based on your computer's OS.

For example, since I'm on a computer running Windows 10 as my OS, then I would choose "Windows hosts".

3. Download the **VirtualBox Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack**.

You'll also need ~5 GB of space for the downloaded `.iso` file, though you can delete the file once you've fully setup the VM.

2. Download Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS by clicking the green **Download 22.04.2** button.

![VirtualBox New Button](/img/docs/onboarding/ubuntu-vm-setup/virtualbox-new-button.png)

2. On the new popup, provide a name that you'd like to identify your VM, the folder in which you'd like to install your VM, and the Ubuntu `.iso` file that you've downloaded. Then click **Next**.

![VirtualBox Name & OS](/img/docs/onboarding/ubuntu-vm-setup/virtualbox-name-and-os.png)

3. Enter a valid username, password, hostname (this is what Ubuntu considers its name as), and enable Guest Additions along with pointing to its `.iso` file. Then click **Next**.

5. Select **Create a Virtual Hard Disk Now** and set a Disk Size of at least 25 GB. Then click **Next**.
